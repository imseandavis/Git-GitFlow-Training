Branching / Merging Strategy
-----------------------------------
GitFlow Base With Different Feature Branches For Each Time Contributing To The Same Project

Code Cannot Be Directly Merged, All Features Being Closed Will Have To Be Done Via Pull Requests

NO DIRECT COMMITS OR PR's TO MASTER WILL BE ALLOWED

Merging Approval Gates Will Be Implemented Requiring a Peer/Lead Review and Approval

Release branch will be implemented

Each Environment May Have Different Approval / Review Policies

Features Should be Tied To A Work Item To Ensure As Few Collisions As Possible

DO'S
--------------
Pull changes always and often
Collaborate and communicate with your team on features 

DO NOT'S
--------------
DO NOT COMMIT WITHOUT PULLING CHANGES FIRST
DO NOT COMMIT WITH A BLANK MESSAGE
DO NOT PULL REQUEST WITH A BLANK OR NON DESCRIPTIVE MESSAGE
